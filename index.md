<!-- ABOUT ME -->
## üëã About Me

Hello! I‚Äôm Dabin Kim, a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://aerospace.snu.ac.kr/en" target="_blank">Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</a> at <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Seoul National University</a>, working in the <a href="http://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Lab for Autonomous Robotics (LARR)</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=TLQUwIMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. H. Jin Kim</a>.

I received my B.S. degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Seoul National University.

My research focuses on **integrating perception and planning** for mobile robots, with particular interests in **sensor-based planning, visual SLAM, safety-critical control, and safe motion planning**.
